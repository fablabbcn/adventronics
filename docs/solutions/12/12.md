# Day twelve:

Use te light sensor to detect when to light up your Barduino as a candle. There is nothing more "Chritsmasy" than the light of a candle, with family, friends or just te blanket on the sofa. Use the Barduino as a candle? Why not!

The idea is to make it automatic, so when it detects a low level of light it will light up simulating a candle, you will need to create a nice animation with the neopixel (don't try to light it up on fire...)

## Possible solution!

### Arduino code

```c++

```
